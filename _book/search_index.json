EDHM EDHM is a R package for hydrological models in order to simplify the models building, specially the distributed hydrological model. In the package contain many complete MODEL that can used directly, and many MODULE that can a new MODEL to building. All of the MODELs and MODULEs are build with matrix-arithmetic, that can good deal with the distributed situation. In the package there are many tools to calibrate the parameters or build a new MODEL or a new MODULE. The Package is only in GitHub published, for the first time use, please install the package EDHM and HMtools use the following code: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) library(devtools) install_github(&quot;LuckyKanLei/HMtools&quot;) install_github(&quot;LuckyKanLei/EDHM&quot;) "],["base.html", "Chapter 1 Basic Concept 1.1 Hydrological Cycle 1.2 Important Concept of EDHM 1.3 Data and Parameter", " Chapter 1 Basic Concept 1.1 Hydrological Cycle Process 1.2 Important Concept of EDHM Process Method Module Model Run_Model Evaluate Calibrate 1.3 Data and Parameter 1.3.1 Variable naming 1.3.2 Data Structure 1.3.3 Data or Parameter "],["develop.html", "Chapter 2 Model Use and Develop 2.1 Model Structure or Concept 2.2 Use Model with a MODEL or Run_MODEL 2.3 Copuling a new Model with MODULE 2.4 Design a new MODULE", " Chapter 2 Model Use and Develop Choose a Model virtue: convenience shortage: poor adaptability 2.1 Model Structure or Concept Design a Model 2.2 Use Model with a MODEL or Run_MODEL 2.2.1 Check the InData list 2.2.2 Data Preparation 2.2.3 Evaluate 2.2.4 Calibrate 2.3 Copuling a new Model with MODULE 2.3.1 Choose MODULE 2.3.2 Set the Data-FLow 2.3.3 Build the MODEL and Run_MODEL 2.4 Design a new MODULE 2.4.1 Method and Formula 2.4.2 Coding the Inhalt 2.4.3 Set In/OutData and Parameter Here is a review of existing methods.
