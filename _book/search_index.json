EDHM EDHM is a R package for hydrological models in order to simplify the models building, specially the distributed hydrological model. In the package contain many complete MODEL that can used directly, and many MODULE that can a new MODEL to building. All of the MODELs and MODULEs are build with matrix-arithmetic, that can good deal with the distributed situation. In the package there are many tools to calibrate the parameters or build a new MODEL or a new MODULE. The Package is only in GitHub published, for the first time use, please install the package EDHM and HMtools use the following code: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;LuckyKanLei/HMtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;LuckyKanLei/EDHM&quot;) The summary of the Processes and Modules show in the following table: Process Module ReferenceET ReferenceET.Hargreaves | ReferenceET.Linacre | ReferenceET.PenMon ActualET ActualET.Gr4j | ActualET.Vic SNOW SNOW.17 | SNOW.Ddf BASEFLOW BASEFLOW.ARNO INTERCEPTION INTERCEPTION.Gash InfiltratRat InfiltratRat.GreenAmpt Infiltration Infiltration.OIER | Infiltration.SER RUNOFF RUNOFF.Gr4j | RUNOFF.OIER | RUNOFF.SER | RUNOFF.Vic | RUNOFF.VM GROUNDWATER GROUNDWATER.Vic ROUTE ROUTE.G2RES | ROUTE.Gr4j "]]
